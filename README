                RHVoice - a Russian speech synthesizer

RHVoice uses the following free software components:
* Russian speech database and Russian language description for
  Festival by Nickolay V. Shmyrev (https://developer.berlios.de/projects/festlang)
  The phoneset and almost all of the main lts rules are used as is,
  but I've made changes in other parts, either to simplify conversion
  to the flite format, or to add new features, or just to understand
  how it all works.
* The voice has been trained with The HMM-based Speech Synthesis
  System (HTS) (http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp)
* The hts_engine API is used for runtime speech generation
  (http://hts-engine.sourceforge.net/)
  Since the library does not support streaming synthesis, the original
  version has been modified to implement this functionality, and the
  synthesizer distribution includes this patched version.
* The C implementation of the Russian text analyzer uses Flite
  (http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite)
  I used the flite's implementation of English language support as an
  example, some functions were used as a starting point.
* the stress information for the stress dictionary has been extracted
  from the test dictionary in the RuLex package by Igor B. Poretsky
  (http://poretsky.homelinux.net/packages/)
* GNU libunistring is used for working with unicode text
  (http://www.gnu.org/software/libunistring/)
